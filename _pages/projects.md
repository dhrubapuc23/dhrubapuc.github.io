  * This web application developed at BITM includes mainly the following features: save course and teacher, assign course to teacher, credit assign to teacher,     allocation and un-allocation of a course, class routine management, and result management.
 
* Diagnostic Center Bill Management System
  * Generally, small diagnostic offers several types of tests like Complete blood count, Lipid profile, USG Lower abdomen etc. 
    Since bill processing for these types of tests requires paper work and is very error prone, this web application was developed to resolve this matter.
